### Hi, welcome to my profile!

My name is Griffin, and I'm a senior at MIT studing Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science. This year, I took a leave of absence to work as a software engineer in New York City for Anheuser-Busch. Though I currently work in Python, I have previously worked with Java as well on a large scale, and know various other languages from personal projects.

I don't make my personal repositories public, but if you'd like to see my work, contact me and I can share some of my projects!

Please feel free to visit my [personal website](https://gansel51.github.io/ "Griffin's Website") for links to my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, or to email me! You can skip the middle man and connect with me on LinkedIn [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffinansel/ "Griffin's LinkedIn")

### Hi, welcome to my profile!

My name is Griffin, and I'm a senior at MIT studing Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science. This year, I took a leave of absence to work as a software engineer in New York City. I have experience as a software engineer in both Python and Java, and currently work primarily with Python.

I don't make my personal repositories public, but if you'd like to see my work, contact me and I can share some of my projects!

Please feel free to message me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffinansel/ "Griffin's LinkedIn") to learn more about my professioanl background! You can also visit my [personal website](https://gansel51.github.io/ "Griffin's Website") for links to my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, or to email me!

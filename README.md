### Hi, welcome to my profile!

My name is Griffin, and I'm a senior at MIT studing Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science. This year, I took a leave of absence for the year to work as a software engineer in New York City. I have experience as a software engineer in both Python and Java, and currently work primarily with Python.

I don't make the repositories of my personal projects public, but if you'd like to see my work, contact me and I can share some of my projects!
